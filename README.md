Mystic BBS One-Liner Utility

This utility was inspired by a situation as a BBS Sysop where 
a user had left an inappropriate entry on the One-Liner that
needed to be removed. There is no way to do this within the 
BBS utilities today so this tool was built to fill that gap.

It allows you to List then Delete any entry that you would like
to remove. It has been tested on Windows but not on Linux
at the time of this writing, but was compile tested on a Mac
so there should be no issues. If you reach out with specific
flavors of Unix you would like, I can do my best to provide
binaries but otherwise all of the code is here to generate 
one for whichever OS targets you wish.
